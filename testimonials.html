            "The man is the Bruce Lee of acting. He's the epitome of talent,
             hard-work, and character transformations."<br> <br>- Woody Harrelson (probably)

            "He's a great actor, but I would suggest that his dialects could use a bit more 
            preparation, particularly his American Southern accent in Con Air.<br><br> - An incorrect sinner

        <div class="testimony">
            "Imagine a swarm of wild bees, a mongoose, and a komodo dragon combined into one animal.
            That is precisely how I would describe Nicolas Cage's acting career."<br> <br>- (likely) Martin Scorsese

        <div class="testimony">
            Once I heard that Nicolas Cage was casted for the role, I didn't even bother to finish writing
            his character's script. He basically gets through half of each of his lines and then
            loses his god-damn mind. The dyanmism is just... incredible. <br><br>-Rob Zombie (maybe)

        <div class="testimony">
            "I would have his baby. No questions asked." <br><br>-Anyone alive today

        <div class="testimony">
            "Nicolas Cage is my best friend. I love him like a brother. I talk to him on a daily basis,
            and I'm so proud of everything he's accomplished in his 1,096 movies" <br><br>-Nicolas Cage
